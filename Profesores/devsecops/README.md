You need to be able to deploy the snake game of the class using pipelines in GitLab.

The process for that is described in the slides of the class.

To consider the exercise achieved you need to provide 3 things:

- A txt file called: 1.txt that will have inside the url of your working snake example (the url link should load a valid working example of the game to be considered OK)
